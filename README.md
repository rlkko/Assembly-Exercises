Welcome to my Assembly exercises list

All programs were made using a custom header that aids with printing and taking data in the console.

The x86 assembly sources were assembled using <a href="https://flatassembler.net/">FASM</a>
The 8085 assembly sources were assembled using <a href="https://www.deus.gr/win85/download.htm">win85</a>
